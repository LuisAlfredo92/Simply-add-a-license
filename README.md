# DEPRECATED
Some months after creating this extension, Visual Studio added a native option to add licenses to your repositories, so this project is no longer maintained.

# _An useful extension to add a license to your project easily._
You can choose between a lot of different licenses, but you'll have quick access to the community favorites:
- Apache 2.0 License
- General Public License v3.0
- MIT License

### _...and many more!_

Add a license easily to your project to be pushed **on the very first commit of your repository!**
